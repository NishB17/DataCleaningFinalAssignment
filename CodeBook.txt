Variables Naming Scheme:
	Starts with Time_: Time Series Data
	Starts with Frequency_: Frequency Series Data
	 
	Contains Body: Values Obtained from Accelerometer and Gyroscope Sensors attached to body
	Contains Gravity: Values Obtained from measurement of Gravity
	 
	Contains mean: it is the mean/average of the Value
	Contains std: it is the standard deviation of the Value
	  
	Contains X/Y/Z: Denotes the axis to which the data corresponds to
	 
	Other Norms:
		Acc: Denotes Acceleration captured by Accelerometer
		Gyro: Denotes the Angles captured by the Gyroscope
		Jerk: Denotes the Momentary Jerk in Signal calculated by differentiaing signals with respect to time
		Mag: Denotes Magnitude of the Signal calculated by using Euclidean Norm

	Subject: Denotes the id of the person who performed the Experiment
	Activity: Denotes the Activity performed while collecting data

Transformations applied to Raw Data:
	Raw Data: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones
	1)  Merging the Subject,X_Test,Y_Test into a Temporary Table with Corresponding Column Names from features.txt using cbind
	2)	Merging the Subject,X_Train,Y_Train into a Temporary Table with Corresponding Column Names from features.txt using cbind
	3)	Merging data from steps 1 and 2 into a new table user rbind
	4)  Removing data not related to mean and standard deviation using select
	5)  Replacing Activity names from activity_labels.txt into tables using inner join
	6)  Renamed Column names to be more descriptive by removing "." formed due to read table and to remove duplicate values
	7)	Expanded "f" and "t" into "Frequency" and "Time" in Column names for better legibility
	8)	Added "_" between words for better readablilty
	9)  Grouped the data with Subject and Action using the group_by function
	10) Summarized the Grouped Data to display mean for all columns for each group with Summarize_all function
